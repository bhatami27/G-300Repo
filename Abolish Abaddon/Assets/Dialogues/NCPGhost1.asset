  - Shiiiiiitttttt.....
  - So you're the one who is supposed to save us?
  - As if, this man looks like he don't even wash his feet.
  - Probably just let the soap run down your legs with ya dirty ass.
  - I was hoping someone who didn't look like a complete bitch would come down here
    and save me before i died but it looks like im fucked either way.
  - I dont know if you can tell or not but im about to die pretty soon.
  - We have all been consumed by the Destroyer.
  - Abaddon has taken our souls allowing him to pull energy from out life forces
  - After while of being in here you begin to become less and less of yourself until
    your gone.
  - It would have been nice to have someone consumed who would be able to help but
    it seems like we are stuck with you
  - Im going to make this quick because it probably is a waste of my breath anyway
  - If you wanna get out of here and save everyone the only way is to fight
  - You must travel around this hell and finding pieces of the map to help you on
    your journey
  - Shit ain't free down here so you better stack your bread up kid
  - You will also have to fight Abaddons demon bosses to increase your power
  - If you somehow get strong enough you'll have to go against Abaddon to free us
    all
  - If you die then we're all fucked so how about using your brain a little befor
    diving into things
  - No pressure tho.
