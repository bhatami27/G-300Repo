  - Shittttt.....
  - So this is who is supposed to save us?
  - As if...this mans looks like he don't even wash his feet.
  - Probably just lets the soap  run down his legs with ya nasty ass
  - Well, if you couldnt tell you have been consumed by the Destroyer
  - Abaddon himself has taken our souls as his own.
  - Using them as a source of energy.
  - As you can see im about to die pretty soon
  - I was hoping maybe someone who didnt look like a complete bitch would be consumed
    so they could save me before i died.
  - Looks like im fucked either way now.
  - Imma make this short because i feel like its a waste of breath
  - Find your way through this hell by finding pieces of the map together.
  - Now nothing down here is free so you better get ur bread up kid
  - The more of Abaddon's Bosses you kill the stronger you will become. Allowing
    you to reach more places in the map.
  - Oh yeah and dont die because everyones soul in here is fucked.
  - 'No pressure tho. '
